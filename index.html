                <h2>General description</h2>
                <p>
                    In the fast-evolving landscape of the last decade, energy consumption, particularly in electricity, has
                    shown a consistent upward trend. Looking ahead, the next 10-15 years are poised for even greater
                    escalation.
                    We recognize the critical need for sustainable solutions in energy consumption, and this realization
                    birthed the sus4 project. The implementation of solutions demands high levels of expertise, posing a
                    significant barrier for small and medium-sized manufacturers, who may not have the capacity to
                    engage specialists.
                </p>
                <p>
                Our mission in the sus4 project is to bridge this gap, making sustainable energy solutions accessible and applicable for small and medium manufacturers. We're committed to demystifying complexity, bringing practical, implementable solutions to the forefront, and empowering businesses to navigate the changing energy landscape seamlessly.
                </p>

                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>
                The sus4 project aims at implementing and commercializing a framework and the relevant digital tools for:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Energy/electricity use optimization.</li>
                        <li>Production planning & optimization of factories.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                The digital platform products of sus4 have been validated in two use cases in Italy and Lithuania and are/will soon be market-available.
